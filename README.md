## React-Redux CRUD App in a Feature-based Folder Sructure

This is a React-Redux CRUD app which I've built for demonstration in my React & Redux tutorial [here](https://kdakan.github.io/React-React-Router-and-Redux/).

This app offers paginated and searchable lists, edit forms, client-side routing, Redux actions and reducers, and an api layer, with Bootstrap components like date picker and notifications, in a feature-based folder structure that is more scalable as the app grows.

Some of the libraries used in this project are:

- react
- react-router-dom
- bootstrap
- react-datepicker
- react-bs-notifier
- redux
- react-redux
- redux-thunk
- redux-logger
- moment

If you're interested in the same app without Redux, see my other app [here](https://github.com/kdakan/react-crud-app/)

To build and run the app:

`npm install`

`npm start`
